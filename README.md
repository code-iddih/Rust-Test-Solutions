# 🦀 Rust Test Solution

## 📌 Description
This Rust program prompts the user to enter five numbers and then calculates:
- 🔢 **Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)** of the numbers.
- 🏆 **Highest Common Factor (HCF)** of the numbers.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Rust 🦀

## 📋 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. You can check by running:
```sh
rustc --version
```
If Rust is not installed, download and install it from [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository or navigate to the project directory.
2. Open a terminal and initialize a new Rust project (if not already done):
   ```sh
   cargo init
   ```
3. Run the program using:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

## 📝 Example Usage
```
Enter five numbers:
12
18
24
30
36
HCF (GCD) of the numbers: 6
LCM of the numbers: 360
```

## 🏗️ How It Works
1. The user inputs five numbers.
2. The program computes:
   - **HCF** using the greatest common divisor (GCD) method.
   - **LCM** using the relationship: `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`.
3. The results are displayed.
